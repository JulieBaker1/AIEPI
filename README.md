# AIEPI
Atlas-level Integrated Epithelial Program Identification

Malignant epithelial cells are the most heterogeneous cell type with almost every patient forming a separate cluster. Here, we present a method, AI-EPI (Atlas-level Integrated Epithelial Program Identification), which identify patient-shared and patient-specific gene modules (GM) simultaneously and efficiently.The
method mainly contains two steps:

-   gene module identification
-   gene module classification

Installation
------------

the package can be installed directly from the github.

```
git clone Juliebaker1/AIEPI
cd AIEPI
pip install requirement.txt
```

Quick start
-----------

Here, we provide an example data of [GBC_epithelial](http://lifeome.net/software/hrg/GBC_epithelial.h5ad) 
from 10X Genomics. Users can download it and run following scripts to understand the workflow of AIEPI.

Step1:gene program identification
------------------

For malignant epithelial cell number vary among patients, we sample the same cell number from every patient so that they are equally weighted.

```
epithelial_downsample_adata = sampling(epithelial_adata)
gene_program = GM_identification(epithelial_downsample_adata) (# output the default error and stability curve)

```
Step2:gene program classification
-------------

In the second step, we distinguish the patient-shared GM from the patient-specific GM by a permutation test p-value.  

```

Downstream analysis
-------------------------------------------------

To ensure our neighborhood relationship is accurate, we use newly found
features to construct SNN again and again until the overlap between the
newly found features and the previous features comes to overlap\_stop,
0.75 by default. If you pursue efficiency and donâ€™t want the iteration,
just set overlap\_stop 0. You can find specific details [here]().

the parameter that user can define.

-   obj:an Seurat object
-   dims:the dimentions of PCA used to construct SNN.(10 by default)
-   nfeatures:the number of features for downstream analysis.(2000 by
    default)
-   overlap\_stop:when the overlap come to this number, iterate will
    stop.(0.75 by default)
-   snn:the neighborhood relationship that is calculated in advance.
-   max\_iteration:the max iteration times
-   neigh\_num:number of neighbors
-   is.save:whether to save intermediate results
-   dir:the save directory

example:

        # find regional distributed genes
        pbmc=FindRegionalGenes(pbmc,dims = 1:10,nfeatures = 2000,overlap_stop = 0.95)
        # the featureplot of the 2 most highly regional genes
        FeaturePlot(pbmc,head(RegionalGenes(pbmc), 2))
