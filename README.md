# AIEPI
Atlas-level Integrated Epithelial Program Identification

Malignant epithelial cells are the most heterogeneous cell type with almost every patient forming a separate cluster. Here, we present a method, AI-EPI (Atlas-level Integrated Epithelial Program Identification), which identify patient-shared and patient-specific gene modules (GM) simultaneously and efficiently.The
method mainly contains two steps:

-   gene program identification
-   gene program classification
